# KPI-Tracking-and-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard
## Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive KPI (Key Performance Indicator) tracking and performance analysis dashboard using Google Sheets. The dashboard is designed to monitor weekly, monthly, and quarterly goals related to product testing, providing real-time insights into performance and enabling management to make data-driven decisions.

## Features
#### 1-Product Testing Tracking:

Weekly performance tracking of the number of products tested.
Comparison against predefined monthly and quarterly goals.
#### 2-Automated Metrics:

Automatically calculates weekly results and compares them with targets to identify performance gaps.
Provides easy-to-read insights using visual indicators (e.g., color-coded cells for target achievement).
#### 3-Goal Setting:

Users can input monthly and quarterly goals, which the template uses to dynamically adjust weekly targets.
#### 4-Data Visualization:

Includes graphical representations of progress (e.g., bar charts, line graphs) to help management quickly assess performance trends.
#### 5-Real-Time Updates:

As new data is input, all metrics and visualizations update automatically, ensuring that the latest performance is always visible.
#### 6-Scalability:

The template is flexible enough to accommodate new KPIs or operational targets, making it adaptable for future use.
How to Use
